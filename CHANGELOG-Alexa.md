# Changelog of Alexa Skill Scheme

Because Alexa doesn't give the way to add description to versions
here will be the Changelog of them

## v30

- add custom `GENRES_IA` type for music genres missed in `AMAZON.Genre` (e.g. "symphony")
- use `GENRES_IA` for `MusicQuerySubject` and `InOneGoMusicPlayback` intents

## v29
